## Keymap

**Two chars serach**:

* Press `s` in normal/visual mode to jump forward.
* Press `S` in normal/visual mode to jump backward.

**Inline jump**:

* Press `f` in normal/visual mode to jump forward.
* Press `F` in normal/visual mode to jump backward.

## Notes

The `S` key in visual mode is conflict with the vim-surround. I am still thinking a workaround.
