# vim-surround

Vim-surround can help you manage the surrounding text easily.

## Keymap

| keymap | functionality                    |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| cs     | Change surround text             |
| ds     | Delete surround text             |
| gs     | Add surround text in visual mode |
| ys     | add surround text in normal mode |

## Addtional

The vim-surround use `S` in visual mode by default, but it is conflict
with the lightspeed.nvim plugin. So it is now set to `gs` now.
